# Garden Client
## Client for TheGardenMC.net

Right now, this does not have much functionality. It launches minecraft and asks for your login every time instead of saving it, which come to think of it, might be a feature lol.

Anyways, If you wanna run it, just

```
git clone https://github.com/fishermedders/garden-launcher.git
cd garden-launcher
npm install
npm start
```

If you'd like to build it, just

```
npm run release
```

Eventually this will become just an optional client for our server or others with cool features and Exclusive Garden Cosmetics and HUD's among other things.
